# Task2_Assignment

This repository contains an RMarkdown file for performing data analysis on the dataset: Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) module of the STOP.
The analysis explores 2 subtasks:
* Dose-response (d-r) modeling
* Identify the most relevant point of departure (POD)

## File Structure

- `Task2_Pipeline.Rmd`: The main RMarkdown file containing the analysis code and narrative.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset used in the analysis.
- `output/`: Directory containing output files generated by the RMarkdown file (e.g., HTML, PDF).

## Dependencies

The following R packages are used in this analysis:

- `ggplot2`: For data visualization.
- `dplyr`: For data manipulation.
- `readr`: For reading data files.
- `knitr`: For rendering RMarkdown documents.

Install these packages using `install.packages()` if you haven't already.
